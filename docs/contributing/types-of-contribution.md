# Types of contributions

### Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/HarshitRV/FileShare/discussions/5).

### Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.
